# Bikes for refugees

The aim of the exercise is for your webpage to look like [this](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-london/html-css/assets/screenshot-complete.png) 
Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and compare it to the image of the final result. What's different?

- Use semantic markup: Where necessary, replace the `<div>`s with semantic HTML tags. This will not render differently in the browser, but it's good practice to use semantic markup when you can!
- Fix the broken images: Some of the links to images are broken. The images you need are in the `images` folder - please replace any broken image links with the correct paths.
- Style buttons: There are 3 buttons on the page. They need to be styled correctly - remember, re-use styles as much as possible by using classes.
- Fix the positioning: Use Flexbox to move elements around so they are positioned correctly
