        alt="Border Collie">
      <p>In general, border collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is more often thick and
        prone to shedding. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While
        black and white is the most commonly seen color pattern of the border collie, the breed appears in just about
        any color and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolor (black/tan/white), liver and
        white, and red tricolor (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue,
        lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold)
        which is seen less frequently. Some border collies may also have single-color coats.</p>

        alt="Border Collie">
      <p>Eye color varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing color occur; this is usually seen with
        merles. The ears of the border collie are also variable â€” some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears,
        and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough collie). Although working border collie handlers
        sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the
        unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general, the American Border
        Collie Association considers a dog's appearance to be irrelevant. Instead, it is considered more useful to
        identify a working border collie by its attitude and ability. </p>

        alt="Border Collie">
      <p>Border collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds.
        The border collie is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. The border collie ranks 1st in
        Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being part of the top 10 brightest dogs. Although the primary role of
        the border collie is to herd livestock, the breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal</p>

        alt="Border Collie">
      <p>In this role, due to their working heritage, border collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They
        thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other
        dogs.[6] Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many border collies
        develop problematic behaviors in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for
        chewing holes in walls and furniture, and destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border collies
        may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The
        breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the border collie was
        developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live
        amicably with other pets if given proper socialization training. </p>
